# Coding_Assignment_1
The goal of this project was to gather and clean data from a website and analyze different attributes of the data by describing the data through graphs. For this project I analyzed the busiest airports in the United States from 2005-2010. I wanted to see if the recession in 2008 affected the number of passengers that boarded each year. In addition, I wanted to see if there were correlations between the success of the prior year of the airport and the year after.

# iata_code: string data type and describes the identification codes that indicate specific airports.
# state: string data type and describes the states in which the busiest airports reside.
# 2010: integer data type and describes the number of passengers that boarded a plane at the airport in 2010.
# 2009: integer data type and describes the number of passengers that boarded a plane at the airport in 2009.
# 2008: integer data type and describes the number of passengers that boarded a plane at the airport in 2008.
# 2007: integer data type and describes the number of passengers that boarded a plane at the airport in 2007.
# 2006: integer data type and describes the number of passengers that boarded a plane at the airport in 2006.

# Potential Bias:
In the collection of this data, there could be bias in the selection of the aiprots and their rankings based off of precedence 
or excluding possible airlines from data collection.
